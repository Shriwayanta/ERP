## üìà Cost-Effectiveness

This solution is designed to provide significant cost savings compared to traditional ERPs. [cite_start]With an estimated total annual cost of ‚Çπ2.20 lakhs, it is approximately 80-85% cheaper than a traditional system, which can cost ‚Çπ10-15 lakhs per year[cite: 154, 156, 158]. [cite_start]This makes it a highly viable option for public colleges with budget constraints[cite: 10].
