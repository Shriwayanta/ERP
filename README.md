# SIH ERP-Based Integrated Student Management System

[cite_start]This project is an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system created for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) to address the challenges faced by public colleges, such as disconnected systems, redundant data entry, and high costs[cite: 5, 7, 9]. [cite_start]The solution provides a unified, cost-effective system using cloud-based tools and AI integration[cite: 10].

## Key Features

[cite_start]The system is broken down into several detailed modules[cite: 22]:

* [cite_start]**Student Admission Module**: Automates the application process with online forms, document uploads, and merit list generation[cite: 25, 26, 27]. [cite_start]It uses AI for document verification via OCR, fraud detection, and eligibility checking[cite: 31, 32, 33]. [cite_start]A chatbot is included to handle student queries[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Fee Management Module**: Facilitates online fee payment and automated receipt generation[cite: 39, 40]. [cite_start]It also manages scholarships and sends automated due date reminders[cite: 41, 43]. [cite_start]AI is used for predictive analytics for fee collection and fraud detection in payments[cite: 45, 47].
* [cite_start]**Hostel Management Module**: Features a room allocation system, occupancy tracking, and management of maintenance requests[cite: 50, 51, 52]. [cite_start]It uses AI to optimize room allocation and predict maintenance needs[cite: 56, 57].
* [cite_start]**Examination Management Module**: Handles exam scheduling, result processing, and progress tracking[cite: 62, 63, 65]. [cite_start]AI integration allows for performance analytics, grade prediction, and automated report generation[cite: 68, 69, 71].
* [cite_start]**Library Management Module**: Manages book check-ins/check-outs and inventory[cite: 74, 76]. [cite_start]It includes an AI-powered book recommendation system and smart search functionality[cite: 79, 82].

## System Architecture

[cite_start]The system is built on a cost-effective, cloud-based architecture using a stack of free or low-cost tools[cite: 10, 20].

**Core Components**:
* [cite_start]**Central Database**: Google Sheets, Airtable [cite: 13, 21]
* [cite_start]**User Interface**: Google Forms, AppSheet, or a custom web app [cite: 14, 21]
* [cite_start]**Processing**: Google Apps Script, Python automation [cite: 15]
* [cite_start]**AI Integration**: Google AI, OpenAI APIs [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]**Dashboard**: Google Data Studio (Looker Studio), Tableau Public [cite: 17, 21]
* [cite_start]**Security**: OAuth, role-based access [cite: 18]

## Cost Analysis

[cite_start]The solution is designed to be highly affordable[cite: 10].

* [cite_start]**One-time Setup Costs**: Approximately ₹17,000, covering domain, hosting, SSL certificates, and development tools[cite: 147, 148].
* [cite_start]**Annual Operational Costs**: Approximately ₹2,20,000, including Google Workspace, AI API costs, and third-party integrations[cite: 150, 151, 152, 153].

[cite_start]This represents an 80-85% cost saving compared to a traditional ERP system, which can cost ₹10-15 lakhs[cite: 156, 158].

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* A Google account with access to Google Workspace services.
* [cite_start]Familiarity with Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and basic web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)[cite: 265, 266].

### Implementation Roadmap

[cite_start]The project follows a phased implementation plan[cite: 127]:
* [cite_start]**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Set up the Google Workspace environment, create the database structure, and implement the authentication system[cite: 128, 129].
* [cite_start]**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6)**: Develop the core modules: Admission, Fee Management, Hostel Management, and Examination[cite: 130, 131, 132, 133].
* [cite_start]**Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8)**: Integrate AI functionalities like the chatbot and predictive analytics[cite: 134, 135].
* [cite_start]**Phase 4 (Weeks 9-10)**: Conduct system testing, performance optimization, and security audits[cite: 136, 137, 138, 139].
* [cite_start]**Phase 5 (Weeks 11-12)**: Deploy the system, provide staff training, and complete documentation[cite: 141, 142, 143, 144].
